Using Libraries in the Real-Time Device Tracking Application

Socket.io: Enabled real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server for live updates on device locations.
Node.js: Served as the back-end runtime environment, efficiently handling asynchronous operations and managing server-side logic.
Express.js: Provided a lightweight and flexible framework for building the API and routing, ensuring smooth communication between front-end and back-end systems.
These libraries worked together to deliver a robust and high-performance solution for tracking devices with precision.
